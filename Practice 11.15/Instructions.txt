We’re going to practice using this checklist, working with Github, and writing some code with a quick and hopefully fun activity!

Get into pairs and choose a small program to write in Python
	This can be from the list on the next slide or something you come up with on your own
Run through the checklist and write your code in the “Edit Code” step
	Remember - the goal is to make it as easy as possible for someone else to understand how your code works quickly
After you finish this (it should take no longer than 45 minutes), pair up with another group and critique their documentation and style
	Look for things like clean formatting, clear comments, and detailed documentation
